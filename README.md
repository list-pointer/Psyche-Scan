## About the Project
It is possible to have more than one solution for the same problem however you don't implement all the solutions.You chose a particular solution that is best for the situation.The selection process has varieties of factors involved and one of the most important factors is accuracy especially when you want to select an algorithm. More the options, more the uncertainty. 

The proposed system Psyche Scan can be used to compare the accuracy of different algorithms and also find the overall accuracy and confidence of the system.

## Objective 
- Comparing the accuracy of different algorithms.
- Implementing a confidence generating
- Implementing a voted classifier.

## Tech

Pysche Scan uses the folwoing Tech:

- [Python]  
- [NLTK Classifiers] 
- [Python Graph Plooting Libraries] 
 

## Installation
- Download the Files and run the project and download all the dependenices
- Make sure you have an active and stable Internet Connection
- Train the model and save the results
- Run the model on test data now and see the output
