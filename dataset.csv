Kinesthetic,Concrete,Piles made of steel concrete are driven into the ground with blows that would shatter the best of timber
Kinesthetic,Concrete,A fuller description of the combination of steel and concrete will be given later
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The constituents of concrete are sometimes spoken of as the matrix and the aggregate and these terms though somewhat oldfashioned are convenient
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The matrix is the lime or cement whose chemical action with the added water causes the concrete to solidify and the aggregate is the broken stone or hard material which is embedded in the matrix
Kinesthetic,Concrete,It has been to a great extent superseded by Portland cement on account of the much greater strength of the latter though lime concrete is still used in many places for dry foundations and small structures
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The hydrated lime after being passed through a fine screen to sort out any lumps unaffected by the water is ready for concrete making and if not required at once should be stored in a dry place
Kinesthetic,Concrete,They have the property of entering into chemical combination with the lime forming a hard setting compound and increasing the hardness of the resulting concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Experience shows that although spherical pebbles are to be avoided Portland cement adheres tightly to smooth flint surfaces and that rough stones often give a less compact concrete than smooth ones on account of the difficulty of bedding them into the matrix when laying the concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In mixing concrete there is always a tendency for the stones to separate themselves from the sand and cement and to form pockets of honeycombed concrete which are neither watertight nor strong
Kinesthetic,Concrete,For firstclass work however and especially in steel concrete it is customary to reject very large stones and to insist that all shall pass through a ring a of an inch in diameter
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The water like all the other constituents of concrete should be clean and free from vegetable matter
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Sometimes in massive concrete structures large and heavy stones as big as a man can lift are buried in the concrete after it is laid in position but while it is still wet
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Such concrete is known as rubble concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In proportioning the quantities of matrix to aggregate the ideal to be aimed at is to get a concrete in which the voids or airspaces shall be as small as possible and as the lime or cement is usually by far the most expensive item it is desir able to use as little of it as is consistent with strength
Kinesthetic,Concrete,If the situation is cool the stone hard and the concrete carefully rammed directly it is laid down and kept moist with damp cloths only just sufficient to moisten the whole mass is required
Kinesthetic,Concrete,On the other hand water should be given generously in hot weather also when absorbent stone is used or when the concrete is not rammed
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In these cases the concrete should be allowed to take all it can but an excess of water which would flow away carrying the cement with it should be avoided
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The thorough mixing of the constituents is a most important item in the production of good concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Roughly it may be said that where a large mass of concrete is to be mixed at one or two places a good machine will be of great advantage
Kinesthetic,Concrete,When mixed the concrete is carried at once to the position required and if the matrix is quicksetting Portland cement this operation must not be delayed
Kinesthetic,Concrete,One of the few drawbacks of concrete is that unlike brickwork or masonry it has nearly always to be deposited within moulds or framing which give it the required shape and which are removed after it is set
Kinesthetic,Concrete,It is essential that they shall be strong and stiff so as not to yield at all from the pressure of the wet concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The shutters must be planed and coated with a mixture of soap and oil so as to come away easily after the concrete is set
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Moreover when depositing the concrete a shovel or other tool must be worked between the wet concrete and the shutter
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Sometimes rough concrete is rendered over with a plaster of cement and sand after the shutters have been removed but this is liable to peel off and should be avoided
Kinesthetic,Concrete,If for important walls or for small scantlings such as steel concrete generally involves the concrete should be deposited in quite small quantities and very carefully rammed ng osit into position
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Depositing concrete under water for breakwaters and bridge foundations requires special skill and special appliances
Kinesthetic,Concrete,It is usually done in one of three ways a By moulding the concrete ashore into large blocks which when sufficiently hard are lowered through the water into position by a crane or similar machine with the aid of divers
Kinesthetic,Concrete,b By moulding the concrete into what are called bagblocks
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In this system the concrete is filled into bags which are at once lowered through the water like the blocks
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But in this case the concrete being still wet can adapt itself more or less to the shape of the adjoining bags and strong rough walls can be built in this way
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The canvas was laid in a hopper barge and there filled with the concrete and sewn up The enormous bag was then dropped through a door in the bottom of the barge upon the breakwater foundation
Kinesthetic,Concrete,c By depositing the wet concrete through the water between temporary upright timber frames which form the two faces of the wall
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Indeed this is bound to happen more or less but it is guarded against by lowering the concrete slowly in a special box the bottom of which is opened as it reaches the ground on which the concrete is to be laid
Kinesthetic,Concrete,This method can only be carried out in still water and where strong and tight framing can be built which will prevent the concrete from escaping
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The concrete escapes from the bag which is then drawn up and refilled
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Concrete may be compared with other building materials like masonry or timber from various points of view such as strength durability convenience of building fire resistance appearance and cost
Kinesthetic,Concrete,for lime concrete and to cwt
Kinesthetic,Concrete,for Portland cement concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The safe tensile strength of Portland cement concrete would be something like onetenth of its compressive strength and might be far less
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Hence slabs or beams of long span should not be built of plain concrete though when reinforced with steel it is admirably adapted for these purposes
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In regard to durability good Portland cement concrete is one of the most durable materials known
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The same praise cannot however be given to lime concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Portland cement concrete on the other hand may be used without fear in seawater provided that certain reasonable precautions are taken
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Considerable alarm was created about the year by the failure of two or three large structures of Portland cement concrete exposed to seawater both in England and other countries
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But to ensure the permanence of structures in seawater the great object is to choose a cement containing as little lime and alumina as possible and free from sulphates such as gypsum and more important still to proportion the sand and stones in the concrete in such a way that the structure is practically nonporous
Kinesthetic,Concrete,On the other hand if the concrete is rough and porous the seawater will gradually eat into the heart of the structure especially in a case like a dam where the water being higher on one side than the other constantly forces its way through the rough material and decomposes the Portland cement it contains
Kinesthetic,Concrete,As regards its convenience for building purposes it may be said roughly that in mass work concrete is vastly more convenient than any other material
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But concrete is hampered by the fact that the surface always has to be formed by means of wooden or other framing and in the case of thin walls or floors this framing becomes a serious item involving expense and delay
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In appearance concrete can rarely if ever rival stone or brickwork
Kinesthetic,Concrete,It is true that it can be moulded to any desired shape but mouldings in concrete generally give the appearance of being unsatisfactory imitations of stone
Kinesthetic,Concrete,These defects will no doubt be overcome as concrete grows in popularity as a building material and its aesthetic treatment is better understood
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Concrete pavings are being used in buildings of first importance the aggregate being very carefully selected and in many cases the whole mixture coloured by the use of pigments
Kinesthetic,Concrete,One of the great objections to the appearance of concrete is the fact that soon after its erection irregular cracks invariably appear on its surface
Kinesthetic,Concrete,In the case of a smooth concrete face there are no joints to follow and the cracks become an ugly feature
Kinesthetic,Concrete,A pleasing rough appearance can be given to concrete by brushing it over soon after it has set with a stiff brush dipped in water or dilute acid
Kinesthetic,Concrete,At one time Portland cement concrete was considered to be lacking in fireproof qualities but now it is regarded as one of the best fireresisting materials known
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Although experi ments on this matter are badly needed there is little Y doubt that good steel concrete is very nearly indestruc tire
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But they are weak and modern experience goes to show that a strong concrete is the best and that probably materials like broken clamp bricks or burnt clay which are porous and yet strong are far better than cinders as a fireproof aggregate
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The steel reinforcement is of immense importance in fireproof work because if properly designed it enables the concrete to hold together and do its work even when it has been cracked by fire and water
Kinesthetic,Concrete,On the other hand the concrete being a nonconductor preserves the steel from being softened and twisted by excessive temperature
Kinesthetic,Concrete,and foundations concrete is nearly always cheaper than brickwork or masonry
Kinesthetic,Concrete,On the other hand for reasons already given thin walls such as house walls will cost more in concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,There are many varieties of concrete known as artificial stones which can now be bought ready moulded into the form of paving slabs wall blocks and pipes they are both pleasing in appearance and very durable being carefully made by skilled workmen
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The introduction of steel concrete also known as ferroconcrete armoured concrete or reinforced concrete is generally attributed to Joseph Monier a French gardener who about the year was anxious to build some concrete water basins
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The important point of his idea was that it combined steel and concrete in such a way that the best qualities of each material were brought into play
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Concrete is readily procured and easily moulded into shape
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But it is difficult and expensive to work up into various forms Concrete has been avoided for making beams slabs and thin walls just because its deficiency in tensile strength doomed it to failure in such structures
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Thus the one point of weakness in the concrete slab is overcome by the addition of steel in its simplest form and both materials are used to their best advantage
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The scientific and practical value of this idea was soon seized upon by various inventors and others and the number of patented systems of combining steel with concrete is constantly increasing
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The majority of these systems have emanated from France where steel concrete is largely used
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The concrete itself should always be the very best quality and Portland cement should be used on account of its superiority to all others
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The proportions generally used are to I and to I in the case of gravel concrete or or I in the case of broken stone concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,But generally speaking in steel concrete the cost of the cement is but a small item of the whole expense and it is worth while to be generous with it
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The mixing and laying should all be done very thoroughly the concrete should be rammed in position and any old surface of concrete which has to be covered should be cleaned and coated with fresh cement
Kinesthetic,Concrete,At first it was feared that such bars would have a tendency to slip through the concrete in which they were embedded but experiments have shown that if the bar is not painted but has a natural rusty surface a very considerable adhesion between the concrete and steel as much as cwt
Kinesthetic,Concrete,Many devices are used however to ensure the adhesion between concrete and bar being perfect
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The structures in which steel concrete is used may be analysed as consisting essentially of I walls columns piles beams slabs arches
Kinesthetic,Concrete,The steel reinforcement is generally applied in the form of vertical rods built in the wall at intervals with lighter horizontal rods which cross the vertical ones and thus form a network of steel which is buried in the concrete
Kinesthetic,Concrete,These rods assist in taking the weight and the whole network binds the concrete together and prevents it from FIG

Auditory Digital,sense,Nothing of what Jule told her made sense with what her father told her
Auditory Digital,sense,Her sense of dread grew as she approached and followed Jonny into his apartment
Auditory Digital,sense,Not an ounce of common sense in any of you

Auditory Digital,sense,The unusual sense of tenderness unfurled again in his breast
Auditory Digital,sense,He pushed the thought of his slain brother away but couldnt escape the lingering sense of unease
Auditory Digital,sense,It made no sense but neither did the sudden craving for peanut butter that dragged her to the kitchen where yet another man she wanted to avoid was lounging
Auditory Digital,sense,A sense of dread filled her as she approached Damians room
Auditory Digital,sense,She swallowed hard and nodded struggling to control the strange sense of desire bubbling uncontrolled within her

Auditory Digital,understand,She doesnt understand how unlikely that is
Auditory Digital,understand,He wasnt going to understand what shed done
Auditory Digital,understand,She didnt understand exactly why except that Gabe was locked out of the underworld
